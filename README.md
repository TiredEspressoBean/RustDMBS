# RustDBMS

RustDBMS is a high-performance, concurrent in-memory database management system (DBMS) written in Rust. It provides efficient data storage, retrieval, and persistence with support for concurrency control and file-based locking.

## Features

- **Concurrency Control:** Utilizes Rustâ€™s `RwLock` to allow safe concurrent access to data, supporting multiple readers and a single writer.
- **Data Persistence:** Stores data using JSON serialization, enabling persistence across program restarts.
- **File-Based Locking:** Implements file-based locking to prevent data corruption during file operations with support for shared and exclusive locks.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Includes a CLI for interacting with the database, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting collections and records.
